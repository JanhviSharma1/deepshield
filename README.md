## DeepShield

DeepShield is an advanced deepfake detection system developed to combat the growing threat of manipulated media. In an age where AI-generated synthetic videos are becoming increasingly realistic and accessible, the need for robust detection tools is more urgent than ever. Deepfakes can be used maliciously to spread misinformation, impersonate individuals, and compromise digital trust.

DeepShield addresses this challenge by leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques to accurately distinguish between authentic and manipulated video content. The system analyzes subtle inconsistencies in facial movements, lighting, pixelation, and audio-visual alignment that are often introduced during deepfake generation.

The goal of DeepShield is to serve as a reliable tool for journalists, content platforms, security agencies, and the general public to verify the authenticity of video material and help preserve truth and trust in digital communications.
